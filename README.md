This mod adds the cute little creature Mantle to LC.

The Mantles are "aggressive" creatures that will only appear indoors. By themselves, they are not a source of danger. However, they can become quite problematic if you are in an area with hazards such as voids, mines, turrets... or if you are trying to escape from a larger threat. They often appear in small groups.
