This mod adds the cute little creature Mantle to LC.

The Mantles are "aggressive" creatures that will only appear indoors. By themselves, they are not a source of danger. However, they can become quite problematic if you are in an area with hazards such as voids, mines, turrets... or if you are trying to escape from a larger threat. They often appear in small groups.

This is my firstmod, so it is bugged on a lot of things (remains playable but buggy). I don't think I tried to fix the bugs either since it was to "test" LC modding and I have other ideas in mind for bigger and more serious mod creations.

I also don't think I'll update the mod if another version of LC comes out (well, it depends if the work behind it is too big).
