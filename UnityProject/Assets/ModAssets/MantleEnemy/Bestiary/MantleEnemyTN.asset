    terranova


    Mantleus terranova are small, non-humanoid creatures known for
    their playful and mischievous nature. Although they are not aggressive, they
    love to play by making objects fly everywhere. Unfortunately, they do not always
    realize their strength and can inadvertently cause harm while playing. However,
    they do not pose a significant danger around doors, heights, and similar obstacles.
    Mantleus terranova primarily rely on their sight to navigate and interact with
    their surroundings. Their cheerful behavior and unique appearance make them endearing
    despite their clumsiness.'
